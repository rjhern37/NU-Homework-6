This is a weather application that allows the user to search the weather for multiple cities. Once the city is searched for, the app displays the current weather conditions. Current conditions displayed include; Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and UV index. Also when a city is searched for there is a five day forcast dispalyed for that city near the bottom of the page indicating what the conditions will be like on the given day. These blocks comprised of the five day forcast are updated dynamically through Javascript and allow for more customization in the future. Take a look around and plan your next vacations with my weather app.
